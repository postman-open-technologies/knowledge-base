# Postman Open Technologies Knowledge Base
This is a project dedicated to mining and extracting knowledge from across the API universe. There is a wealth of knowledge present in the OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman Collections, Spectral, and other API artifacts available here on GitHub, but also the open web. This is a project to harvest those artifacts and begin making sense of them.

## Purpose
To establish a framework for harvesting, ingesting, storing, querying, and publishing findings from across OpenAPI, Swagger, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman Collection artifacts harvested from GitHub, the Postman Network, and the open web. 

## Research and Findings
The initial focus of the knowledge base is around the Open API specifications version 2 and 3. Consult our OAS Summary report for information on current research topics, questions, findings, and documentation. These reports are automatically updated on a daily basis.

- [OpenAPI Summary](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/blob/main/R/oas/oas_summary.md) - Some query based findings.
- [OAS Spectral Ruleset](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/blob/main/R/oas/oas_spectral_ruleset_postman_postman-library.md) - The default Posstman Spectral Ruleset.
- [OAS HTTP Status Codes](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/blob/main/R/oas/oas_spectral_ruleset_postman_http-status-codes.md) - Breaking of IANA status codes.

Our platform has however been designed to be generic and capable of handling various types of resources. We expect to shortly start exploring other specifications such as AsyncAPI, gRPC, GraphQL, Postman collections, Spectral rules, and more.

## Get Involved
We are using the following channels to manage the work around the knowledge base. Find the channel that works for you, and feel free to get involved.

- [Public API Workspace](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Open-Technologies---Kno~9ae364c1-2c5a-4e9a-9d1a-ea8c78ad80f0/overview) - We are building out a series of APis to help us access this data via REST and GraphQL APIs.
- [Open Questions](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aquestion) - These are the open questions we are working on, prioritizing them based upon which ones are most interesting.
- [Some Tasks](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atasks) - These are some of the open tasks of the different things happening around this project, helping share the load.
- [Wiki Documentation](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/wiki) - We are working to document everything in motion using the GitHub Wiki, so if there is anything missing, feel free to start a discussion or open an issue.
- [Active Discussions](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/discussions) - All of the conversations around these questions and findings will be happening via the GItHub discussion board.

This work is happening out in the open to encourage the community to ask questions and help power this work, expanding the knowledge we extract from APIs.
