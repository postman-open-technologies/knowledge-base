# Postman Open Technologies Knowledge Base
This is a project dedicated to mining and extracting knowledge from across the API universe. There is a wealth of knowledge present in the OpenAPI, Swagger, Postman Collections, Spectral, and other API artifacts available here on GitHub, but also the open web. This is a project to harvest those artifacts and begin making sense of them.

## Purpose
To establish a framework for harvesting, ingesting, storing, querying, and publishing findings from across OpenAPI, Swagger, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Postman Colleciton artifacts harvested from GitHub, the Postman Network, and the open web. 

## Research and Findings
The initial focus the knowledge base is around the Open API specifications version 2 and 3. Consult our OAS Summary report for information on current research topics, questions, findings, and documentation. These reports are automatically updated on a daily base.

- [OpenAPI Summary & Findings](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/knowledge-base/blob/main/R/oas_summary.md)

Our platform has however been designed to be generic and capable of handling various types of resources. We expect to shortly start exploring other specifications such as AsyncAPI, gRPC, GraphQL, Postman collections, Spectral rules, and more.

## Support
If you'd like to get involved you can submit questions via the issues for this repository, or visit the [Open Technologies Knowledge Base workspace](https://postman.postman.co/workspace/Postman-Open-Technologies---Kno~9ae364c1-2c5a-4e9a-9d1a-ea8c78ad80f0/overview) to work with the different collections we have attempting to answer these questions.
