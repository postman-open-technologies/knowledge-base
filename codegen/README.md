# Postman Open Technologies Code Generation Knowledge Base
Dedicated to knowledge regarding code generation from (but perhaps not limited to) API definitions/sources. The aim is to provide questions/answers related to the use of code generation related to APIs. While OpenAPI is the dominant API definition format it is not the only avenue with which code generation is built upon.
