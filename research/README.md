# Knowledge Base: Research and Findings

The initial focus the knowledge base is around the Open API specifications version 2 and 3. Consult our [OAS Summary](../R/oas_summary.md) report for information on current research topics, questions, findings, and documentation. These reports are automatically updated on a daily base.

Our platform has however been designed to be generic and capable of handling various types of resources. We expect to shortly start exploring other specifications such as AsyncAPI, gRPC, GraphQL, Postman collections, Spectral rules, and more.
