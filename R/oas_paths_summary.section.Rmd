- The average number of path per API is `r format(round(df$avg_paths[1],1), big.mark = ",")`, ranging from `r format_count(df$min_paths[1])` to `r format_count(df$max_paths[1])`.
- Out of the `r format_count(df$n_has_path[1])` APIs with a path, `r format_count(df$n_01_to_05_paths[1])` (`r format_pct(df$pct_01_to_05_paths[1])`%) have 1-5 paths, `r format_count(df$n_06_to_10_paths[1])` (`r format_pct(df$pct_06_to_10_paths[1])`%) have 6-10 paths, `r format_count(df$n_11_to_20_paths[1])` (`r format_pct(df$pct_11_to_20_paths[1])`%) have 11-20 paths, `r format_count(df$n_21_to_50_paths[1])` (`r format_pct(df$pct_21_to_50_paths[1])`%) have 21-50 paths, and `r format_count(df$n_over_50_paths[1])` (`r format_count(df$pct_over_50_paths[1])`%) have over 50 paths.
