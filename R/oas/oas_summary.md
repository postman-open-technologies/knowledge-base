<sup>*DISCLAIMER: the results and findings below are preliminary and
have not been fully validated or peer reviewed. Use with care. Do not

This document enumerates the research questions and topics we are
investigating in the knowledge base around OpenAPI specifications and
provides a summary of findings. More in-depth analysis is available for
selected topics.

## Size

### What is the typicaly size of an API?

<sup>See [size analysis](oas_size.md) for further details.<sup>

- Based on 23,345 valid API specifications, the average JSON size is
  33.7Kb, ranging from \< 1Kb to 7,575Kb.
- No significant difference is observed between version 2 (33.1Kb) and 3
  (34.1Kb)
- Some interesting differences are observed between API from the Postman
  public network vs APIs collected the Internet
- Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that assessing API size can be
  challenging as we may do not have the full definition when the
  specification is spread across multiple files

## Validity and source of errors

### How many valid OpenAPIs do we have?

<sup>See [validity analysis](oas_validity.md) for further details.<sup>

- Out of 29,720 APIs, 23,345 (78.5%) are valid.

### What are the primary sources of error in APIs?

*This research topic will be initiated shortly*

## Server

<sup>See [servers analysis](oas_servers.md) for further details.</sup>

### How is the server property used in APIs?

- Out of 7,851 valid OpenAPI2 specifications, 5,958 (75.9%) have a
  `host` property, 5,684 (72.4%) have a `basePath` property, and 6,316
  (80.4%) have a `schemes` property.

- Out of 15,494 valid OpenAPI3 specifications, 12,906 (83.3%) have a
  `servers` property, with an average of 1.2 server/entry, and a range
  of 0-13.

### How often do APIs use localhost vs domain based servers?

- Out of the 20,985 host/servers entries (across all APIs), 4,919
  (23.4%) contain localhost or 127.0.0.1, 12,028 (57.3%) use a DNS host,
  and 807 (3.8%) use a variable template (3.x only). 1,867 (8.9%) use a
  relative path (no server specified).
- 6,823 (32.5%) use an http protocol, and 11,292 (53.8%) https.

### What are the most commonly used top level domains?

- The top 3 most commonly used top level domains in our API collection
  are swagger.io (1,128), swaggerhub.com (1,005), and azure.com (551).

## Paths

<sup>See [paths analysis](oas_paths.md) for further details.</sup>

### How is the path property used in APIs?

- The average number of path per API is 11.9, ranging from 1 to 1,550.
- Out of the 22,809 APIs with a path, 13,800 (60.5%) have 1-5 paths,
  3,078 (13.5%) have 6-10 paths, 3,005 (13.2%) have 11-20 paths, 1,998
  (8.8%) have 21-50 paths, and 928 (0.04068569%) have over 50 paths.

## JSON Schema

### What is average number of locally defined JSON objects per API?

- The average number of JSON objects defined locally under /definitions
  (OpenAPI2) or /components/schema (OpenAPI3) is 20.1, ranging from 1 to
  2,146.
- Out of the 20,093 APIs, 9,918 (49.4%) have 1-5 entries, 3,132 (15.6%)
  have 6-10 entries, 2,634 (13.1%) have 11-20 entries, 2,426 (12.1%)
  have 21-50 entries, and 1,983 (9.9%) have over 50 entries.

## Licensing

### How is the license property used in APIs?

- Out of 23,345 valid APIs, 8,421 (36.1%) have a `license` property,
  with 5,353 (22.9%) providing both the `name` and `url`.
- Out of the 147 v3.1 APIs with a license, 5 (3.4%) use the `identifier`
  property (introduced in 3.1).

### What is the breakdown of licenses use by the APIs?

- Analysis based on a simple harmonization method looking at terms in
  the license name and url values indicates that 3,164 (37.6%) of the
  APIs use an Apache license.
- Other notable categories include MIT (40%), Creative Commons (5.3%),
  GNU/GPL (2.8%).
- 10.7% are categorized as Other.

## Security

### How are the security related properties used in APIs?

<sup>*Note that in OpenAPI3, `securityDefinitions` was renamed to
`securitySchemes` and moved inside `components`, and the `type: basic`
was replaced with `type: http` with `scheme: basic`.*</sup>

- Out of 23,345 valid APIs, 6,835 (29.3%) have a `security` property.

- For OpenAPI2, out of the 7,851 valid APIs, 3,413 (43.5%) have a
  `securityDefinitions` property. The `type` is distributed as 2,235
  (45.9%) apiKey, 2,005 (41.2%) oauth2, and 624 (12.8%) basic.

- For OpenAPI3, out of the 15,494 valid APIs, 8,031 (51.8%) have a
  `components/securitySchemes` property. The `type` is distributed as
  3,199 (32.9%) apiKey, 4,843 (49.8%) http, 1,535 (15.8%) oauth2, 77
  (0.8%) openIdConnect, and 77 (0.8%) empty value.

- As only 1,501 (19.1%) of v2.x and 5,334 (34.4%) of v3.x APIs have a
  `security` property, it suggest that the security schemes may not
  always be used. This requires further investigation.

## Responses

### What is the breakdown of status codes in the OpenAPIs responses?

<sup>See [paths operations analysis](oas_paths_operations.md) for
further details.<sup>

- Across all 898,451 responses, the most common codes or values are
  `200` 294,619 (32.8%), `400` 99,843 (11.1%), `404` 91,201 (10.2%),
  `401` 81,843 (9.1%), and `500` 66,448 (7.4%)
