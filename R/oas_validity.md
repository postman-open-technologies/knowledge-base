# Findings

## *How many valid OpenAPIs do we have?*

- Out of 15,674 entries, 12,117 (77.3%) are valid and 3,557 (22.7%) are
  invalid
- 4,630 out of the 5,934 OpenAPI2 entries are valid (78%)
- 7,487 out of the 9,740 OpenAPI3 entries are valid (76.9%)

## *Which top level paths of API specifications are the source of validation errors?*

<sup>See [source of errors](oas_validity_errors.md) for details and more
in-depth analysis around validation issues.<sup>

- A total of 58,501 validation errors are found across 3,557 invalid
  APIs
- Looking at the *error* counts, 46,246 (79.1%) are found under `paths`.
  This is followed by 5,088 (8.7%) under `components`, 4,355 (7.4%)
  under `definitions`, 1,152 (2%) under `root`, and 599 (1%) under
  `info`
- Looking at the *API* counts, 2,163 (39.3%)have at least one error
  under `paths`. This is followed by 949 (17.3%) under `root`, 774
  (14.1%) under `components`, 490 (8.9%) under `info`, and 307 (5.6%)
  under `definitions`
- Keep in mind the `definitions` property is only used by OpenAPI 2.x
  and `components` by OpenAPI 3.x (as v2 `definitions` became
  `components/schema` in v3)
- `root` in the above findings mean an error at the highest level of the
  API specification (not under a property path)

# Methodology

Results are based on the count of the `isValid` boolean property in the
resource metadata. This flag is set by the `kb_oas_validation.py`
script, which uses the JSON schemas published under the [OAI GitHub
project](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/tree/main/schemas).
Validation is performed by the Python
[jsonschema](https://github.com/python-jsonschema/jsonschema) package.
Validation errors are saved in a local file for further analysis.
